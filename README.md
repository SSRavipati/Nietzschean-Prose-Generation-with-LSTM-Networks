# Nietzschean-Prose-Generation-with-LSTM-Networks
This project implements a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate text that mimics the philosophical style of Friedrich Nietzsche. By training on a corpus of his work, the model learns not just vocabulary, but the structural patterns, punctuation, and "tone" of the author.
